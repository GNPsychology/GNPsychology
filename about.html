            <h3>Psychologist</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I am a Registered Psychologist with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) 
                and hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Psychology, as well as a Master of Philosophy in Psychology. 
                With extensive experience in both private practice and educational settings, I provide therapy for a range 
                of concerns, including anxiety disorders, depression, trauma, low self-esteem, mood disorders, and relationship issues.           
            </p>
            <p>
                I employ a variety of evidence-based therapeutic approaches, including Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), 
                Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Schema Therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions. My practice is 
                grounded in a client-centered philosophy, prioritizing empathy, understanding, mutual respect, and collaboration. 
                I strive to create a warm, non-judgmental space where clients feel safe to explore their challenges and work towards 
                meaningful change.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am particularly passionate about working with diverse populations and welcome clients from 
                various cultural backgrounds. As someone with a Pakistani heritage, I am fluent in Urdu and 
                Punjabi, and I am committed to providing culturally sensitive care to those who may feel more 
                comfortable conversing in their native language.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are seeking support on your journey towards personal growth and healing, I invite you to reach out.
            </p>
