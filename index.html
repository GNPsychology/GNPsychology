            <hr>
            <p>
                I am a Registered Psychologist with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Psychology, as well as a Master of Philosophy in Psychology. With extensive experience in both private practice and educational settings, I provide therapy for a range of concerns, including anxiety disorders, depression, trauma, low self-esteem, mood disorders, and relationship issues.</p>
            <p>
                My practice is grounded in a client-centered philosophy, prioritizing empathy, understanding, mutual respect, and collaboration. I strive to create a warm, non-judgmental space where clients feel safe to explore their challenges and work towards meaningful change.
